In admin panel, when you add or edit a post or page you can:

* specify additional authors, by selecting and adding them in the "Co-authors" panel. (See Screenshots #1)

* put the shortcode "[sp-authors]" to display the list of co author's links separated by comma.


When the post/page is displayed to user: 

* you can see the list using the shortcode that can be added in the add post page
